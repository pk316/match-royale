### Description

Match Royale is a Clash Royale themed memory match game made up of 18 cards. When the game loads, 9 pairs of character cards are randomly selected and CSS animation places everything into position. The goal is to match each card with it's pair. With each attempt at matching the cards, the accuracy and attempt section will update.
